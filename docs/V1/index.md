# Version 1.x

## Introduction

Version 1 was written to replace `ganbarodigital/php-reflection`. It offers pretty much the same functionality as that library did, just with an improved interface.

## Key Ideas

The key ideas in Version 1 are:

* [Checks](Checks/index.html) to provide `true` / `false` statements about a variable's type
* [Requirements](Requirements/index.html) to enforce the data types your code is prepared to handle

## Components

Version 1 ships with the following components:

Namespace | Purpose
----------|--------
[`GanbaroDigital\TypeChecking\V1\Exceptions`](Exceptions/index.html) | exceptions thrown by this library
[`GanbaroDigital\TypeChecking\V1\Checks`](Checks/index.html) | tools to inspect variables
[`GanbaroDigital\TypeChecking\V1\Requirements`](Requirements/index.html) | enforce required variable types

Click on the namespace to learn more about the classes in that component.
